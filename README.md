# Django-Skeleton


A skeleton for a django site that organizes code into:

*   project/apps - Where all apps reside
*   resources - Our static files directory ( will be created upon 'syncdb' )
*   <site-name> - where our manage.py is.
*   conf - where our environment specific settings will live (ex. production, integration, etc)
*   bin - where we have a script to create the base site (Usage: `setup-site.py <site-name>`)

You should setup your virtualenv in the root directory.
